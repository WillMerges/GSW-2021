# this is what packets coming from the rocket should look like sent over RF
# the ground receiver then forwards this packet to the groundstation using UDP
# it is expected that the 'port' listed is used as the src and dst port of the UDP packet
# 'addr' is the ipv4 address of the receiver
#
# every measurement MUST be byte aligned currently
# whether this padding is done by the ground station or by the receiver is TBD
# measurements are given by [measurement name] [measurement size in bytes]
