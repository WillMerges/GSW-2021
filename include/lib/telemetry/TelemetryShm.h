/*
* Telemetry shared memory is per-vehicle
* Each vehicle can have multiple telemetry packets stored in shared memory
* Each telemetry packet will get it's own shared memory block to be stored in
* Each telemetry block will have a corresponding nonce stored in shared memory
* There is also be a 'master block' containing locking information for the whole vehicle
*
* Currently locking is vehicle-wide
* Regardless of which packet(s) are being read/written there is one lock
* e.g. even if two writers are writing to different packets only one can write at a time
* unsigned int* packet_id, size_t* offset
* The above limitation can be solved by storing an entire info block for each
* packet rather than just a nonce. To block on multiple packets would require
* creating a thread for each packet and blocking on that packets nonce from the
* info block. The overhead for creating and cleaning up several threads is likely
* too high to make this method better than sharing a single lock for a small number
* of packets. The master nonce could still be updated and used as a way to block
* until any packet has changed.
